                <p>Hello and welcome to the first chapter of arithmetic. I should start of by saying that arithmetic is very fundamental to mathematics as a whole. You can sort of think of it as those large wooden blocks you might have played with as a toddler. Using those large wooden blocks we can build the large looming skyscrapers of modern mathematical results. The process of building is arithmetic and the techniques, theorems, and proofs you build might get very complicated but they can always be broken down into the fundamentals of arithmetic. This should be encouraging, it certainly encourages me, because essentially if you can master arithmetic and its properties you can learn anything in mathematics, and I mean anything. Even the most complicated of mathematical papers can be disected into a very complicated chain of arthimetic operations. So if you want to learn mathematics, arithmetic is step one, and the first step of step one is numbers.</p>

                These are the numbers used in most number systems around the world, most people call them digits, but a more technical name is Arabic numerals because of their Hindu-Arabic origin. In order from left to right we have zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine for a total of ten different digits. Hover over the digits to see there names. These digits can then be grouped together to create bigger or smaller numbers, such as the number ten.

                You aren't just limited to putting two numbers together like one and zero to make ten, you can stick as many digits together as you like. You could have a number made up of a thousand digits, or a million digits, or a billion, they can even, in some cases, have an infinite number of digits. But what do all these digits actually mean and what exactly is happening when we put the one and zero together to make ten. And this is where we start our discussion of value, specifically decimal value.

                Before we move to decimal value we should first touch on just regular old value. Value is a concept that people are familiar with from a very young age, so some of the following content may seem redundant. The definition of value can get very philosophical, but essentially something has value in the context of mathematics if it can be represented as a number. This definition may raise controversy, but for the sake of keeping things easy to comprehend at this stage, we'll stick with it. Now lets look at the value of some digits.
            </div>
            <video class="animation" src="../resources/arithmetic/a2.mp4" loop></video>
            <div class="paragraph" id="p5">
                The value of one in this case means a single grey circle, the value of two means a pair of grey circles and so on and so forth. This means that the digit one represents singularity, whether that is a physical object, an idea, or something further abstract. Similarly, the digit two represents duality, the digit three representing a triple, and so on. To keep things from getting too confusing here is the best way to put it, in mathematics we associate a digit, a symbol, with a certain value, case closed.

            <div class="paragraph" id="p6">
                Alright, but what does decimal value mean? Well, we now have a better understanding of value, but to really understand decimal value we need to know what the word "decimal" means. The word "decimal" is commonly used to descibe our number system. If you do a quick Google search for the word decimal, it will spit out something along the lines of relating to ten or the power of ten. This is how our number system works, after you work through all ten of the digits, in order to keep counting up, you have to add another place. Since we have ten digits we go through all ten numbers before moving on to the next place, also called a decimal place. Hopefully this next animation will help make better sense of things.
