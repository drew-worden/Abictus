                <p>Hello and welcome to the first chapter of arithmetic. I should start of by saying that arithmetic is very fundamental to mathematics as a whole. You can sort of think of it as those large wooden blocks you might have played with as a toddler. Using those large wooden blocks we can build the large looming skyscrapers of modern mathematical results. The process of building is arithmetic and the techniques, theorems, and proofs you build might get very complicated but they can always be broken down into the fundamentals of arthmetic. This should be encouraging, it certainly encourages me, because essentially if you can master arithmetic and its properties you can learn anything in mathematics, and I mean anything. Even the most complicated of mathematical papers can be disected into a very complicated chain of arthimetic operations. So if you want to learn mathematics, arithmetic is step one, and the first step of step one is numbers.</p>

                These are the digits used in most number systems around the world. In order from left to right we have zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine for a total of ten different digits. Hover over the digits to see there names. These symbols can then be grouped together to create bigger or smaller numbers.
