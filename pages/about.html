        <h1><a href="../pages/index.html">Welcome to Axioma</a></h1>
        <div id="text">
            Some of you may have stumbled upon this website in search of some sort of eternal 
            truths, the ability to distance one’s self from all material objects and enter the realm of
            pure mathematics, or you are simply looking for help on homework. Whatever the reason,
            I’m glad you’re here and I hope what you find can be helpful. If your wondering who I
            am, my name is Drew Worden and I am a mathematician and programmer. This site,
            which I call Axioma, is a pet project of mine where I combine my love for web development
            and data with the growing need for a modernized mathematical curriculumn, along with
            some cheesy jokes and some of my nerdy humor. The purpose of Axioma in my eyes is to be
            a complete interactive maths textbook. Now that’s a tall order, mathematics alone is a huge
            field of study and making it interactive on the web is an even bigger challenge, but this
            project isn’t really supposed to have an end, but rather keep on expanding indefinitely. If you’d
            like to support me and my journey of keeping educational content like this free, then there is a
            link below, but otherwise delve into the content I have put together so far and keep checking
            back in the future. Also, if you would like to get in touch with me, leave me a suggestion, or point
            out a typo, all of the contact info is below as well. That enough talking for now, see you later.
