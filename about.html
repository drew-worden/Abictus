                    Some of you may have stumbled upon this website in search of some sort of eternal 
                    truths, the ability to distance one’s self from all material objects and enter the realm of
                    pure mathematics, or you are simply looking for help on homework. Whatever the reason,
                    I’m glad you’re here and I hope what you find can be helpful. If your wondering who I
                    am, my name is Drew Worden and I am a mathematician and programmer. This site,
                    which I call Abictus, is a pet project of mine where I combine my love for web development
                    and data with the growing need for a modernized mathematical curriculumn, along with
                    some cheesy jokes and some of my nerdy humor. The purpose of Abictus in my eyes is to be
                    a complete interactive maths textbook. Now that’s a tall order, mathematics alone is a huge
                    field of study and making it interactive on the web is an even bigger challenge, but this
                    project isn’t really supposed to have an end, but rather keep on expanding indefinitely. If you’d
                    like to support me and my journey of keeping educational content like this free, then there is a
                    link below, but otherwise delve into the content I have put together so far and keep checking
                    back in the future. Also, if you would like to get in touch with me, leave a suggestion, or point
                    out a typo, all of the contact info is below as well. That enough talking for now, see you later.
